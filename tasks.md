# Documentation

- Edit funcion headers
- Write vignette
- set up github page
- write first workflow article
- note: I absolutely forgot, but apparently I started already a demo document in ~/doc/documentation.Rmd and also added a test watershed in ~/inst/extdata ?!

# Code

- remove dependency on euptf (solved)
- Check if statement in set_nodata in load_soilgrids
- Have we updated issues with layer naming? (Daniels issue)
- Idea: convert extent, extent of raster etc to bbox shape file, would solve many 
  issues concerning bounding area.
- Implement soil parameter calculation
- more to come...
