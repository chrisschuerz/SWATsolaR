# SWATsolaR
SWAT - Soilgrids data aggregation in R


## Installation
To use the *SWATsolaR* package requires some other software and R packages to install prior to the installation of *SWATsolaR*. To be able to access the *soilgrids* layers located on the ISRIC geoserver from within an R session the software **GDAL** is needed. The easiest way to obtain a version for Windows is to download it from this link ([gdal-201-1800-x64-core.msi](http://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1800-x64-gdal-2-1-3-mapserver-7-0-4/gdal-201-1800-x64-core.msi)).
